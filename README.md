# U.S. Government Debt Analysis – Excel Project

This repository contains an analysis of U.S. government debt trends and projections from 1997 to 2023.     
The study explores yearly debt percentage increases, historical monthly growth patterns, and projected future trends. The analysis includes Debt Held by the Public, Intragovernmental Holdings, and Total Public Debt Outstanding.

## Project Overview
This project aims to:

+ Analyze the yearly percentage increase in public debt
- Identify monthly trends in debt accumulation
+ Forecast the future growth of publicly held debt
- Provide insights into economic factors affecting U.S. debt levels

## Methodology
The dataset was cleaned and analyzed using Microsoft Excel, applying Pivot Tables, Power Query, and the FORECAST.ETS function for trend projection.
### Yearly Debt Percentage Increase
- Cleaned and structured the dataset for accuracy
+ Used Pivot Tables to analyze yearly debt trends
+ Applied the formula:
Percentage Increase = (Current Year Debt - Previous Year Debt) / Previous Year Debt * 100
Identified key economic events impacting debt fluctuations

### Monthly Patterns in Debt Growth
+ Filtered data by month to assess seasonal trends
- Used Pivot Tables to determine months with highest and lowest debt increases
+ Examined consumer behavior influence on debt fluctuations

### Public Debt Growth Projections
- Applied FORECAST.ETS function in Excel to project debt from 2023 to 2027
+ Excluded incomplete data for accuracy
- Identified long-term debt trends and potential economic impacts

## Key Findings
+ Between 2016 and 2019, U.S. public debt increased by an average of 5% annually
- In 2020, debt growth spiked due to the COVID-19 pandemic economic response
+ January, February, November, and December had the highest increases, correlating with consumer spending patterns
- April to July showed lower debt increases
+ Publicly held debt is projected to surpass $35 trillion by 2027

## Lessons Learned
